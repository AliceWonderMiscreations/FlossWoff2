Inconsolata
-----------

This is a monospace font quite often used by WordPress themes. It is only
available in Regular (weight 400) and Bold (weight 700) upright, there is not
an italic variant.

This font is included because the WordPress theme TwentyFifteen likes to use
it.

Montserrat
----------

Montserrat is a sans-serif font inspired by old posters and signs in the
Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires where the designer, Julietta
Ulanovsky, observed them.

I have not seen those posters and signs, but the font is beautiful.

This font has both Upright and Italic variants in all nine of the standard font
weights:

* Thin (weight 100)
* Extra Light (weight 200)
* Light (weight 300)
* Regular (weight 400)
* Medium (weight 500)

This font is included because it used by the WordPress theme TwentySixteen.

Montserrat Alternates
---------------------

This is a companion font to Montserrat with some letter forms drawn differently.

Like Montserrat, it has both Upright and Italic variants in all nine of the
standard font weights:

* Thin (weight 100)
* Extra Light (weight 200)
* Light (weight 300)
* Regular (weight 400)
* Medium (weight 500)
* SemiBold (weight 600)
* Bold (weight 700)
* Extra Bold (weight 800)
* Black (Weight 900)

This font is included because it is part of the same font project on
[github](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat). It appears to be the desire
of the font creator that the two fonts be kept in sync, and the easiest to do
that is keep them together.

Noto Sans
---------

Noto is a font project by Google intended to solve the problem of systems that
do not have installed fonts capable of displaying particular glyphs that a
document may request.

In that respect, it really is intended as a *system font* rather than as a web
font.

This is the standard Sans-Serif font from that project.

On Google Fonts it is only available in the upright and italic variants of two
weights, Regular (weight 400) and Italic (weight 700). However as a system font
they are available in all nine of the standard weights and that is how I also
am hosting them:

* Thin (weight 100)
* Extra Light (weight 200)
* Light (weight 300)
* Regular (weight 400)
* Medium (weight 500)
* SemiBold (weight 600)
* Bold (weight 700)
* Extra Bold (weight 800)
* Black (Weight 900)

This font is included because it is an extremely commonly encountered web font
and is also used by the WordPress TwentyFifteen theme.

### Compatibility Note

design can reference any of the nine standard weights. However if you then
switch back to Google Fonts, only the 400 and 700 weights will work.

Sans Condensed" as the font family.

Noto Mono
---------

Noto is a font project by Google intended to solve the problem of systems that
do not have installed fonts capable of displaying particular glyphs that a
document may request.

In that respect, it really is intended as a *system font* rather than as a web
font.

This is the standard Monospace font from that project. Interestingly, it is not
available from Google Fonts.

Presently, it is only available as an upright font in a single weight, the
Regular (weight 400) variant. The lack of a bold weight may be why Google Fonts
does not yet host it.


Noto Font Note
==============

The Noto Fonts here are actually incomplete. For example, Hebrew is not
covered even though Noto fonts for Hebrew exist.

I consider that to be a bug, and it will be fixed through the use of Unicode
Ranges to define what font is grabbed for what characters.

I still have a little research to do in that respect.
